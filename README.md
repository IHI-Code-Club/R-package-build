<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repo contains the slides for my seminar on building R packages.
Slides are built in Rmarkdown using the `xaringan` package. The first
section is the slides, followed by a live package build. The package we
built is available at: <https://github.com/chrismainey/brilliant>
